## Intro to Mobile App Development Lifecycle

This is the first post of my blog LetsXamarin and here we will be learning about Xamarin and the technologies related to it. As we move forward towards learning Xamarin I would like to mention that I will keep my posts as short and minimal as possible so that we all can learn and understand easily. So we will start with the Introduction of Mobile Development Lifecycle or the steps to follow to develop Mobile application:


1. **Idea**
2. **Design (Wireframe, UX, UI, Protypes)**
3. **Development**
4. **QA testing and Bug fixes**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

Remember, there are no hard and fast rules to follow these steps in order and usually depends on the SDLC methodology that you or your team is using. Some of the mostly used methodologies are:


- **Agile**
- **Lean**
- **Waterfall**
- **Iterative**
- **Spiral**
- **DevOps**
